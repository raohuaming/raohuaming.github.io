<p>Recent research has shown that, in addition to the quality and representations of project ideas, dynamics of investment during a crowdfunding campaign also play an important role in determining its success.  To further understand the role of investment dynamics, we did an exploratory analysis by applying a decision tree model to train predictors over the time series of money pledges to campaigns in Kickstarter to investigate the extent to which simple inflows and first-order derivatives can predict the eventual success of campaigns.</p>

<p>The results based on the  the values of money inflows are shown in Figure 1:</p>

<ul>
<li>As expected, the performance of the predictors steadily improves.</li>
<li>With only the first 15% of the money inflows, out predictor can achieve 84% accuracy.</li>
<li>The most “active” periods could be around the first 10% as well as between the 40-60%.</li>
</ul>


<p><img class="center #" src="/images/sbp14/result2.png" width="1000" height="1000" title="&ldquo;Figure 2: Prediction accuracies over time by using the derivative of money inflows and the selected significant time before current time&rdquo;" ></p>

<p>The results based on the the derivative of money inflows are shown in Figure 2:</p>

<ul>
<li>The performance of the predictors does not increase much until the very last stage.</li>
<li>The most important period also does not change until the end, jumping from 5% to 100%.</li>
</ul>


<p>So according to the above results, we reach the conclusion:</p>

<ul>
<li>The periods around 10% and 40%-60% during a campaign had a stronger impact.</li>
<li>“Seed money” (init 15% money inflow) may probably determine the final result of a campaign.</li>
<li>Don’t give up and you can still make it at the very end of the campaign.</li>
</ul>
