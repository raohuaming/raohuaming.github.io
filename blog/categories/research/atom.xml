<p>Recent research has shown that, in addition to the quality and representations of project ideas, dynamics of investment during a crowdfunding campaign also play an important role in determining its success.  To further understand the role of investment dynamics, we did an exploratory analysis by applying a decision tree model to train predictors over the time series of money pledges to campaigns in Kickstarter to investigate the extent to which simple inflows and first-order derivatives can predict the eventual success of campaigns.</p>

<p><img class="center #" src="/images/sbp14/result1.png" width="1000" height="1000" title="&ldquo;Figure 1: Prediction accuracies over time by using the values of money inflows and the selected significant time before cur- rent time&rdquo;" ></p>

<p>The results based on the  the values of money inflows are shown in Figure 1:</p>

<ul>
<li>As expected, the performance of the predictors steadily improves.</li>
<li>With only the first 15% of the money inflows, out predictor can achieve 84% accuracy.</li>
<li>The most “active” periods could be around the first 10% as well as between the 40-60%.</li>
</ul>


<p><img class="center #" src="/images/sbp14/result2.png" width="1000" height="1000" title="&ldquo;Figure 2: Prediction accuracies over time by using the derivative of money inflows and the selected significant time before current time&rdquo;" ></p>

<p>The results based on the the derivative of money inflows are shown in Figure 2:</p>

<ul>
<li>The performance of the predictors does not increase much until the very last stage.</li>
<li>The most important period also does not change until the end, jumping from 5% to 100%.</li>
</ul>


<p>So according to the above results, we reach the conclusion:</p>

<ul>
<li>The periods around 10% and 40%-60% during a campaign had a stronger impact.</li>
<li>“Seed money” (init 15% money inflow) may probably determine the final result of a campaign.</li>
<li>Don’t give up and you can still make it at the very end of the campaign.</li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>(This post is originaly published in CrowdResearch.org, <a href="http://crowdresearch.org/blog/?p=8186"> link </a>.)</p>

<p><img class="center #" src="/images/hcomp13/SpLIT.png" width="1000" height="1000" title="&ldquo;A spatial location identification task (SpLIT)&rdquo;" ></p>

<p>We created a spatial location identification task (<strong>SpLIT</strong>), in which humans examine a 3D camera view of an environment to
infer its spatial location on a 2D schematic map (e.g. a floor plan). However, the SpLIT are often difficult to automate
because the identification of salient cues often requires semantic features that are challenging to recover from the
image and the map, especially when the cues are ambiguous or do not provide sufficient information to pinpoint the exact
location.</p>

<p>One natural question to ask is how one can leverage human computation to perform a typical SpLIT. In order to find the
answer, we designed a study using Amazon Mechanical Turk to investigate how turkers can perform the task in two kinds of
reward schemes: ground truth and majority vote, even when they were not familiar with the environment.</p>

<p>We carefully chose five pictures represent different levels of ambiguity, in terms of the extent to which workers could
use the pre-defined markers (cues) to infer the location of the camera view.</p>

<p>The results are listed below: <!--more--></p>

<ol>
<li><p>The accuracies of each task under both schemes drop as the level of ambiguity increases. This suggests that the lack
of spatial cues did make the task harder. And it is obvious from the figure that performance in majority vote scheme
was better than that in the ground truth reward scheme.</p>

<li><p>We also calculated the accuracies of individual participants, it showed that there were more turkers that at least
chose one correct location in the majority vote scheme than in the ground truth one. In addition, the percentage with
high ac- curacies (0.8 and 1.0) in the majority vote scheme is also higher than that in the ground truth one.</p>

<li><p>To summarize the results, we found that the majority vote reward scheme in general led to a higher level of precision
and reliability in the answers provided by the workers.</p>

</ol>


<p>Though there were not enough data to fully understand this result, the current study is clearly a first step towards
understanding how human computation can be incorporated into applications that support spatial tasks</p>
