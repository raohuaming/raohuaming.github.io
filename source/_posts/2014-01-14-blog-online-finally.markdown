Finally my blog gets online! I have been planing to setup my own blog for
years.  Well, I'm really a typical procrastinator. But anyway I make
it.

Thanks to [github page](http://pages.github.com), which hosts my blog
for free! Meanwhile I also have to give the credit to
[Octopress](http://octopress.org), an amazing framework of blog aware
static site generator. Actually I have tried many tools before (such as
[Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com), [ Jekyll ](http://jekyllrb.com),
[webgen](http://webgen.gettalong.org) etc.), but Octopress is the most
handy one.

I'm planning to share some ideas or articles about my research (machine
learning, HCI, crowdsourcing, social computing), rails development,
novel technologies and of course my life. 

At the end, may all my dear friends and myself have a very happy year!
Get on fire, 2014!
